Podcasts are an integral part of my life since 2005. I listen to them when commuting, walking,
working out, or doing the chores, -- pretty much any time I don't have to communicate, or focus too
much on something I'm doing. I'll keep my personal list up to date right here. I'd also love to hear
new suggestions from you; so please do comment.
